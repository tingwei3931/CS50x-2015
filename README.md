# cs50-pset7
My take on pset7 from MOOC CS50 course.

This problem set is about designing a website as a share trading platform via the API from yahoo.finance.com. I implemented several functionalites
like buying, selling, getting quotes and display the portfolio by building on top of the code distributed. 

Future add-ons include:
* implementing the forgot password functionality
* integrating flask-mail into forgot password 
* visualize stock data using pyGal
* (possibly) stock analysis and prediction using Machine Learning
